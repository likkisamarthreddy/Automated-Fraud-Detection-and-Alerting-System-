# UML Object Diagram (Supporting Structural View)

The object diagram represents runtime instances of classes at a specific
point in time.

Objects:
- txn1 : Transaction
- engine : RuleEngine
- analyzer : RiskAnalyzer
- alertService : AlertService

This diagram illustrates how a transaction object flows through the system
and triggers an alert.
