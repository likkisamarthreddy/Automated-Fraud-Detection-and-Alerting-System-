# Automated-Fraud-Detection-and-Alerting-System-

Automated Fraud Detection and Alerting System
 Project Overview

The Automated Fraud Detection and Alerting System is designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real time using rule-based checks and machine learning techniques. The system processes high-volume transactions with low latency and generates alerts for suspicious activities, enabling quick response and manual review when required.

 Objectives

Detect fraudulent transactions in real time

Reduce false positives using intelligent fraud scoring

Provide instant alerts to operations teams

Ensure secure, scalable, and reliable transaction processing
